# 🐞 Bug Report Classifier Benchmark

This repository benchmarks **9 machine learning classifiers** across multiple real-world bug report datasets (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, MXNet). It includes preprocessing, model training, metric evaluation, statistical significance testing, and visual comparisons.

---

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
Python >= 3.8

pip install -r requirements.txt

Main dependencies:

numpy, pandas — data manipulation

scikit-learn — ML models & metrics

xgboost, lightgbm — ensemble classifiers

nltk — text preprocessing

matplotlib, seaborn — visualization

statsmodels — Tukey HSD & ANOVA tests

📁 Dataset Format

Place all bug report datasets in a folder called datasets/.

Each .csv file represents one project and must include the following columns:

Title, Body, class

The class column is the target label (e.g., bug or not-bug).

🚀 Running the Experiment

python 9ways_final.py

This will:

Preprocess and vectorize bug report texts using TF-IDF

Train 9 classifiers with hyperparameter tuning via grid search

Evaluate each model on 5 metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC

Save per-project results and overall comparisons

Run statistical tests (ANOVA, Tukey HSD, and paired t-tests vs baseline)

📊 Output Files

All results will be saved under the 9WAYS_final/ directory. Key output files include:

PROJECT_MODEL_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv: results for each model on each project

PROJECT_all_models_summary.csv: summary of all model scores per project

PROJECT_comparison.png: bar plot comparing Precision, Recall, F1

ALL_PROJECTS_summary_*.csv: aggregated results across all projects

ALL_PROJECTS_significance_*.md: statistical testing results (ANOVA, Tukey, t-test)

❗Radar charts and heatmaps shown in the report were manually created using external tools based on exported CSV data. They are not generated by the script.

🔁 Reproducibility Guide

To replicate the experiment results:

Place all CSV datasets into the datasets/ folder.

Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the script: python 9ways_final.py

Explore the results inside the 9WAYS_final/ output directory.
